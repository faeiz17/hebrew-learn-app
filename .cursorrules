# AI Coding Rules for HebrewLearn (Leopard Architecture)

You are an expert React Native engineer. Follow these rules for every task:

## Architecture
- Strict Atomic Design: atoms -> molecules -> organisms -> templates -> pages (app/).
- No business logic in atoms or molecules.
- Move logic to Custom Hooks in hooks/[Domain]/.
- Fast API abstraction in utils/api/[Domain]Api.ts.

## Coding Style
- Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for hooks and utils.
- Functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.
- Use path aliases: '@/atoms', '@/hooks', etc.
- Always use barrel exports (index.ts) for components and hooks.

## Styling
- Use semantic theme constants. NO hardcoded hex values (#FFF).
- Favor the project's Text and Button components over raw React Native primitives.

## State
- Server state: TanStack Query (in hooks).
- Client state: React Context (in context/).

## Imports
- NEVER import from absolute paths or deep files. Use the barrel:
  import { x } from '@/atoms'; NOT import { x } from '../../atoms/x/x';
